# Face-Expression-Classifier

This project purpose is to build a model which could predict human face expression.

## Dataset

The dataset is contain a collection of thousands face expression in grayscale format. Each picture has been classified into 7 labels of expression :
1. angry
2. disgust
3. fear
4. happy
5. neutral
6. sad
7. surprise

More over, the author of dataset also has been divided each picture into training and validation dataset in folder form.

## Goals

Goals of this notebook is creating computer vision model to detect face expression from human face image. Author will comparing the model between vanilla approach and transfer learning approach using feature vectors from pre-trained model VGG19.
